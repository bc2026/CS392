# Opening files in C


```
#include <stdio.h> 

FILE fp = fopen(path, "w+");

if (fp == NULL) {

	fprintf(stderr, "error in opening file\n");
	exit(EXIT_FAILURE):
}

/* do file processing */

fclose(fp);

```

# W+

on succ, fopen returns a file pointer which represents the file itself;
for io, this pointer is used for the rest;

Use fgets when you want to read one line at a time;

fscanf(fp, "%d", &var); <- everytime fscanf is ran threough each line is puti into the var variable
fprinf(...) <- do same args as above in order to print everythng


FILE* stream = fopen(argv[1])



# Pointers

int first = 10;
int second = first;
int* third = &first;

Third points to first. But second only has the same value as first. 

printf("%d", "%d", "%d", first, second, third);


Doing third++; also changes the value of first since they are connected thru pointer


clang is passby value: passing a copy

You can't change the value of a variable in a function. 

int fun(int& a)
{
	a++;
}

You cannot do the above in C.

int& is a passby reference. 

int fun(int* p)
{
	(*p)++;
}
